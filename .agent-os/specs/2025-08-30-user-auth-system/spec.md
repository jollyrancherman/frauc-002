> Spec: User Authentication and Verification System
> Created: 2025-08-30
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a user authentication and verification system with social login options (Google, Facebook, Apple, email), SMS phone verification, basic profiles with optional images, password recovery, location collection during registration, and account management (deactivation). Users can browse items without accounts but need to register to interact.

## User Stories

1. **Easy Registration** - New users can quickly sign up using social media or email, with the ability to exit and resume registration
2. **Phone Verification** - Users verify their phone numbers via SMS to build trust in the marketplace
3. **Profile Management** - Users can create basic profiles with name, location, description, and optional profile image
4. **Account Recovery** - Users can recover access to their accounts through password reset functionality

## Spec Scope

1. Social authentication integration (Google, Facebook, Apple, email/password)
2. SMS phone verification system
3. Progressive registration flow with save/resume capability
4. User profile creation and management
5. Password recovery and reset functionality
6. Location collection during registration
7. Account deactivation/management system
8. Permission system (browse without account, register to interact)

## Out of Scope

- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Government ID verification 
- Advanced user roles and permissions beyond basic account status

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can register with social media or email and complete phone verification
2. Users can create and manage basic profiles with location and optional image
3. Users can browse the marketplace without accounts but must register to interact (bid, message, list items)
4. Users can recover account access through password reset
5. Administrators can deactivate user accounts
