# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Free Item Listings
> Created: 2025-08-30
> Status: Planning

## Overview

The Free Item Listings feature enables users to give away items for $0 through a structured queue-based claiming system. This feature implements one of the 5 core listing types in the marketplace, allowing listers to efficiently distribute free items through a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue where claimants can join and provide their availability preferences.

The system prioritizes fairness through queue ordering while giving listers control over pickup scheduling and requirements. Items automatically expire after 14 days to maintain marketplace freshness, and location-based filtering ensures relevant matches between listers and claimants.

## User Stories

### As a Lister (Item Giver)
- I want to create free item listings with images and descriptions so potential claimants can see what I'm offering
- I want to set specific pickup requirements (time windows, accessibility needs, etc.) so claimants know what to expect
- I want to see a queue of claimants with their preferred pickup times so I can efficiently schedule handoffs
- I want to work through the queue in FIFO order so the system remains fair to early claimants
- I want my listings to expire after 14 days so I don't have to manage stale posts
- I want to receive notifications when someone joins my queue so I can respond promptly
- I want to specify my general availability schedule so claimants can align their preferences accordingly

### As a Claimant (Item Seeker)
- I want to browse free items anonymously so I can explore without creating an account first
- I want to search and filter by categories, location, and radius so I can find relevant items nearby
- I want to join a queue for items I'm interested in so I have a fair chance at claiming them
- I want to provide my pickup date/time preferences when joining a queue so scheduling can be coordinated
- I want to receive notifications about my queue position and scheduling updates so I stay informed
- I want to see the lister's pickup requirements before joining a queue so I know if I can accommodate them
- I want to authenticate only when ready to claim an item so the barrier to browsing remains low

### As a Platform Administrator
- I want listings to automatically expire after 14 days so the platform doesn't accumulate stale content
- I want location-based filtering to work efficiently so users see relevant nearby items
- I want queue management to be automated and fair so disputes are minimized
- I want to track engagement metrics on free listings so we can optimize the feature
